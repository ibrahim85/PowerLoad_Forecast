### [Abstract]

Machine learning is an effective approach for short-term electricity load demand forecasting. While accurate load forecasting is pivotal for the economic and secure operation of the power system, there have been continuous efforts to achieve high load forecasting accuracy. There are two main ways to do this: the first is the improvement of the performance of the learning algorithm, and the second is how well the data features are extracted through the pre-processing process.  

Conventional machine learning algorithm such as neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) are trained by gradient based algorithm, which usually suffer from local-optima and slow training speed. Deep Learning (DL) algorithm has been proposed based on a large number of hidden layers to learn high-level features, and have shown promising performance. However, its training burden is always heavy. In recent year, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) technique has been proposed algorithm using single hidden layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN) with faster learning speed and better generalization performance. However, given complex dataset, its performance may not be always satisfactory. Most recently, Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (H-ELM) has been developed based on ELM with stacked multilayer. It combines the advantages of both DL and ELM, and can be a promising tool for load forecasting. In this paper, we design H-ELM based model for predicting the electricity load of Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) data. Owing to the very fast training/tuning speed of ELM and multilayer concept, H-ELM show that the training efficiency and the forecasting accuracy are superior over the competitive algorithms and get better performance due to data pre-processing.
