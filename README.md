# PowerLoad_Forecast

###[Abstract]

Since the concept of machine learning has been devised, there have been efforts to have better performance in various ways. There are two main ways to do this: the first is the improvement of the performance of the learning algorithm, and the second is how well the data features are extracted through the preprocessing process. There are four basic and advnaced learning algoithms: 1) Machine Learning(ML) algorithm which is trained by gradient based algorithm and known as a basic concept of learning algorithm; 2) Deep Learning(DL) algorithm, based on ML algorithm and having more hidden layers allow to learn high-level features; 3) Extreme Learning Machine algorithm            ; and 4) Hi Extreme Learning Machine(H-ELM)           . 
In this paper, we design an algorithm for predicting power usage based on Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) data. It is designed to perform the performance evaluation according to the above four methods of learning algorithm and data feature generation pre-processing. Owing to the very fast training/tuning speed of ELM and multilayer concept, H-ELM show that the training efficiency and the forecasting accuracy are superior over the competitive algorithms.
